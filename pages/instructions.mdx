## Calculate the greenhouse gas impact of different farming systems

    The base scenario is a two year corn-soybean rotation. The default settings for that rotation and for the environmental conditions are averages for the county you chose from the clickable map. If desired, you may adjust some or all of the default settings to more accurately represent the cropping system and area you are interested in.

    - Chose to have the data presented in either Metric or Imperial units by clicking the appropriate button at the bottom of the page.
    - Adjust some or all of the default baseline scenario settings for:

      - Crop (use drop down arrows)
      - Yield (enter new number)
      - Tillage (use drop down arrow)
      - Fertilizer (enter new number)
      - Environmental Conditions (enter new data)

    - If needed, "Remove" or "Add another year to the rotation" by clicking the appropriate buttons and then changing the default settings as desired.
    - The greenhouse gas cost is represented in a graph (top of page) and in a table (right side of the page). Click on the "i" to learn about what the data means.

## How do other cropping systems compare to this cropland?

    The graph you created above is the "base scenario". To compare one or more cropping systems to the "base scenario":

    - Click "Add scenario" and a new scenario will appear above the "base scenario".
    - Adjust the default settings and delete/add years to the rotation as desired.

    The number next to each graph is the greenhouse gas cost difference between that scenario and the "base scenario". A green (negative) number means that the new cropping scenario is better for the environment than the base scenario: it has a lower greenhouse gas cost. A red (positive) number means the new cropping scenario has a higher greenhouse gas cost (worse for the environment)
